            <li>
            From raising money for charity to exploring untouched destinations, Yanisa, 43, and Mick, 
            who is in his 50s, have had some epic adventures with their riding buddies and, of course,
            their trusty Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
            </li>
            <li>
            Their inspirational stories came to light during Harley-Davidson's #HDFreedomStoriesAsia
            crowdsourcing campaign last July and August, which called for contributions from riders
            around the region.
            </li>       
            <li>
            Speaking to AsiaOne, the two Thai riders delve deeper into their hobby, which has now
            turned into a way of life.

                  Yanisa, who works as a distributor in the
                  construction materials industry, is no stranger to 
                  getting around on a motorcycle. But it was only in
                  March 2020 that she began to take it seriously as 
                  a hobby as she had "nothing to do" during the
                  pandemic.</p>

            <div class="lng">

                    <li>
                        In fact, she was so serious about it that she sprang for her dream ride, a Pan America.</li>
    
                    <li>"I have always dreamed that if I could afford a nice motorcycle one day, it would be a Harley
                        Davidson," Yanisa says, adding that the bike is "such a classic".</li>
    
                    <li>Rather than using her bike just to commute, however, Yanisa began taking trips to the Thai
                        countryside to immerse herself in nature. She particularly loves the northern provinces of Chiang
                        Mai, Chiang Rai and Nan.</li>
    
                    <li>"Because I am so fond of nature, and most of the places we go to are very difficult to reach by
                        car," explains Yanisa.</li>
                        
                    
                    <li>"Getting dirty, falling, or being a bit hurt is so fun."

                <h1>Riding is a family affair</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gaming consultant Mick isn't the only motorcycle enthusiast in his family.</li>
                     
                    <li>Mick, the assistant director of the Harley Owners' Group (HOG) Chiang Mai Chapter, says that 
                        not only does his wife ride on "almost every trip", but his eight-year-old son also tags along on 
                        some of his shorter expeditions.</li>
                        
                    <li>Another constant in Mick's trips is his Road Glide — he tells us proudly that he's covered over
                        40,000km over the past two years, and he's not slowing down.
                        
                    <li>Eventually, the goal is to visit every single province in Thailand, he says.</li>
                        
                    <li>"Not just passing through but living and covering all the interesting spots in every province."</li>
                        
                    <li>Mick's bucket list also includes destinations that are a bit more far-flung. Think Cambodia, 
                        Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the famed Route 66 in the United States.</li>
                        
                    <li>"Riding has no definition nor exact meaning to it, you need to be on the bike to know that
                        feeling," he says in an attempt to explain the allure of exploring uncharted territory on two 
                        wheels. "As for me, it's the freedom in the open road and that connection to the surroundings, 
                        and it isn't about the destination that you are riding to, but the satisfaction in between."</li>
                        
                    <li>Despite the exotic destinations on his bucket list, Mick tells us that his most memorable trip so far
                        has been a local one.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>More stories of freedom</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yanisa's and Mick's stories are just two of the many uncovered during the
                        #HDFreedomStoriesAsia crowd sourcing campaign. As part of the initiative, riders from Korea,
                        Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and
                        Indonesia took to social media to share all about their journeys as Harley-Davidson riders, and 
                        what Harley-Davidson means to them.</li>

                    <li>Besides celebrating Harley-Davidson riders in the region who share a deep-rooted 
                        relationship with the brand, the campaign also aimed to spotlight the camaraderie forged 
                        between them on the open road and inspire a new wave of riders.
                    </li>

                    <li>The winning riders with the most unique and compelling stories were selected to be featured 
                        in Freedom Stories 2.0, a series of short films which served to preserve their treasured 
                        memories and inspire the next generation of riders.</li>
    
                    <li>If you've enjoyed reading all about Mick and Yanisa so far, the films, which focus on each
                        rider's life, first rides, passions and their love for motorcycles, will be right up your alley.</li>
